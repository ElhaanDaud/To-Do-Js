[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c480c4ce-66d7-4bc4-9f75-934ab71d56a7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/todolist-elhon/deploys)

This is a simple To Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, allowing users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "ADD" button. Input validation ensures that empty tasks cannot be added.

- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them. A visual indicator is provided by toggling a "checked" class on the task item.

- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete button next to each task. This allows for easy removal of unwanted or completed tasks.

- **Background Image Cycling**: The application features a dynamic background with cycling images. This adds visual interest and enhances the user experience.

- **Local Storage**: User's tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing them to persist even after the page is refreshed or closed. This ensures that users can resume their task list across sessions.
